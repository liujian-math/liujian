                   1. One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application, 
                          because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns, and that's what we love, and that's what we get off on. 
                          --Danica Mckellar

                   2. You do not study mathematics because it helps you build a bridge. You study mathematics because it is the poetry of the universe. Its beauty transcends mere things.
                          --Johnathan David Farley
                   </p>

                   3.  The most painful thing about mathematics is how far away you are from being able to use it after you have learned it.

                   4.   The art of doing mathematics consists in finding that special case which contains all the germs of generality.
--David Hilbert
